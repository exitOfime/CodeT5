## What is SketchUp?
 
SketchUp is a 3D modeling software that was originally developed by Google in 2000. It was acquired by Trimble in 2012 and has since been updated with new features and improvements. SketchUp is designed to be easy to use, intuitive, and fun. You can draw, push, pull, rotate, scale, and paint your models with simple tools and commands. You can also add textures, materials, lighting, shadows, and animations to your models.
 
SketchUp has two main versions: SketchUp Pro and SketchUp Free. SketchUp Pro is the premium version that offers more advanced features and capabilities, such as custom styles, solid tools, layout tools, dynamic components, import and export options, and more. SketchUp Pro requires a subscription fee that starts from $299 per year. SketchUp Free is the web-based version that offers the basic features and functions of SketchUp. SketchUp Free is free to use for personal projects and does not require any installation or registration.
 
## How to Download SketchUp 2023 for Free
 
If you want to download SketchUp 2023 for free, you have two options: SketchUp Free or SketchUp Pro trial.
 
SketchUp Free is the easiest way to get SketchUp for free.

You will be redirected to the web-based app where you can start creating your models right away. You don't need to download anything or sign up for anything. However, SketchUp Free has some limitations compared to SketchUp Pro. For example, you can only save your models online on Trimble Connect (up to 10 GB of storage), you can only export your models as PNG or STL files, and you can only access a limited number of extensions and 3D Warehouse models.
 
SketchUp Pro trial is another way to get SketchUp for free. You can download the full version of SketchUp Pro 2023 for a 30-day trial period. You just need to visit the official website of SketchUp (https://www.sketchup.com/try-sketchup) [^1^] and click on the "Download" button. You will be asked to fill out a form with your name, email address, country, industry, and reason for trying SketchUp. After submitting the form, you will receive an email with a link to download the installer file for Windows or Mac. You can then install SketchUp Pro 2023 on your computer and start using it for free for 30 days. However, after the trial period expires, you will need to purchase a subscription or uninstall the software.
 
If you need to install SketchUp without an internet connection, you can also download the offline installer file from the official website of SketchUp (https://www.sketchup.com/offline-download) [^2^].
